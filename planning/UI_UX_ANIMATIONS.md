# Murph - UI/UX Enhancement & Animation Status

## 1. Goal

Create a visually stunning, modern, dynamic, and trustworthy user experience using subtle but impactful animations and micro-interactions with Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS.

## 2. Core Principles

*   Subtlety, Performance, Meaningful, Consistency. *(Guiding Principles)*

## 3. Implementation Status

*   **Framer Motion Integration:** Installed and used for page transitions, list item entrances, checkmark feedback, logo animation. *(Implemented)*
*   **Tailwind CSS Transitions:** Used for basic hover effects. *(Implemented)*
*   **Implemented Animations:**
    *   **Page Transitions:** Basic fade-in/slide-up via `PageTransitionWrapper`. *(Implemented)*
    *   **List Item Entrance:** Staggered fade-in/slide-up for `ConsultationCard` (via `ConsultationsSection`) and `ChatMessage` (via `AnimatePresence` in `MessageList`). *(Implemented)*
    *   **Button Micro-interactions:** Scale effect via `animateInteraction` prop applied to key CTAs. Color transitions handled by Tailwind/Shadcn defaults. *(Implemented)*
    *   **Form Submission Feedback:** Animated checkmark (`AnimatedCheckmark`) used on relevant forms/buttons after success. *(Implemented)*
    *   **Loading States:** Shadcn `Skeleton` components used with `animate-pulse`. Custom `LoadingSpinner` component created. `Loader2` used inline in buttons. *(Implemented)*
    *   **SVG Animations:** Logo draw animation implemented in `Logo.tsx`. *(Implemented)*
    *   **Hover Effects:** Card lift/shadow effect implemented on `ConsultationCard`. Nav link hovers use Shadcn defaults. *(Implemented)*
*   **Planned / Not Yet Implemented / Needs Refinement:**
    *   **Layout Animations (Dashboard Tabs):** Attempted implementation caused errors and was reverted. Needs alternative approach (e.g., CSS transitions, client-side tab content component). *(Reverted)*
    *   **Landing Page WOW Effect:** 3D animated background on scroll. *(Not Started)*
    *   **Logo Size:** Increase size in Header. *(Requested)*
    *   **Color/Backgrounds:** Introduce more creative color/background schemes beyond default white/muted. *(Requested)*
    *   **Card Interaction Consistency:** Ensure all cards use click-on-card interaction model. *(Requested)*
    *   **Refinement:** Thorough review of all existing animations for smoothness, timing, performance, and overall aesthetic feel.

## 4. Next Steps for Polish

1.  Address requested UI fixes (Logo size, Card interaction).
2.  Explore options for Landing Page WOW effect.
3.  Review overall color scheme and background usage.
4.  Refine timings and easing of existing animations.
5.  Investigate alternative for smooth dashboard tab transitions if desired.
